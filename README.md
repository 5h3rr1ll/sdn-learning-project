# sdn-learning-project

# Goal of this project (Why)
In this project we want to train good developer habits like clean code principles, design patterns, modular architecture, using behaviour driven development (bdd) and test drivenen devolpment (tdd) methodologies and all this while collaborating through git and pull requests.

# How we will roll (How)
We will formulate user stories to derive tasks and have some kind of roadmap.
All features will be planed in a modular way so they can be independently used and the whole app can be extended or altered if wanted.

# What we will program (What)
As context we will create a shopping app.
